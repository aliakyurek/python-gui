# python-gui
Sample code and applications showing GUI development on Python

## Getting started

To use each app you first need to install the requirements. In most cases
the only requirements are PyQt5, and occasionally requests. To install
app-specific requirements change to the folder of the app and run:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    
Once the requirements are installed, you can run the app using Python 3.

    python3 main.py
